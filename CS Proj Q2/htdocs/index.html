			<p> Climate change adversely influences our
			ecosystems in the worst ways possible. Climate
			change is an utmost concern as it could
			deliberately harm the different parts of our only
			home. I came up with this topic to share some
			pieces of information and prevention on climate
			change. Therefore, let us try our hardest to
			restore its beauty.</p>

			<h2 class="title" style="text-align: center">CAUSES</h2>

			<p class="paragraph">Generating electricity and heat by burning fossil fuels causes a
				large chunk of global emissions.
				The manufacturing industry is one of the largest contributors to
				greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.
				Deforestation, together with agriculture and other land use
				changes, is responsible for roughly a quarter of global
				greenhouse gas emissions. Most cars, trucks, ships, and planes
				run on fossil fuels.
				That makes transportation a major contributor to greenhouse
				gases, especially carbon-dioxide emissions.
				Food production is a major contributor to climate change. And
				greenhouse gas emissions also come from packaging and
				distributing food. So does the consumption of goods such as
				clothing, electronics, and plastics.
				A large chunk of global greenhouse gas emissions are linked to
				private households. Our lifestyles have a profound impact on
				our planet.</p>

			<h2 class="title" style="text-align: center">EFFECTS</h2>
			<img class="images" src="../images/image2.jpg" alt="effect image" width="500px" style="text-align: center">
			<p class="paragraph"> As greenhouse gas concentrations rise, so does the global
				surface temperature.
				Destructive storms have become more intense and more
				frequent in many regions. (Including Philippines!)
				Many people now face the threat of not having enough water on
				a regular basis as llimate change is changing water availability,
				making it scarcer in more regions.
				Changes in the climate and increases in extreme weather events
				are among the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor
				nutrition.
				Lastly poses risks to the survival of living organisms both on
				land and in the ocean.</p>
